# Instacart--DB-Normalization


This project focuses on the **normalization of the Instacart database**, ensuring efficient data organization, reduced redundancy, and improved data integrity. By restructuring the database, the project enhances performance and enables seamless data analysis for business insights.

Key steps involve analyzing the existing schema, identifying anomalies, and normalizing the database to achieve higher normal forms (2NF and 3NF). The process includes splitting tables, defining relationships, and ensuring proper indexing to optimize data storage and retrieval.

The refined database schema supports critical business functions such as user order tracking, product inventory management, and sales reporting. This optimization is particularly beneficial for large-scale e-commerce platforms like Instacart, which handle vast amounts of transactional data.

This repository provides SQL scripts and detailed documentation of the normalization process, including entity-relationship diagrams (ERD) to illustrate the improved design. The project is a practical resource for developers, database administrators, and data analysts aiming to enhance the efficiency of relational databases.

Explore this project to learn how normalization principles can transform complex datasets into scalable and maintainable solutions, ensuring optimal database performance for real-world applications.
